# **CodeBook**
This document describes "Tidy" dataset generated by 'run_analysis.R' script.
This script was developed in accordance with "Assignment 4" of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course of "Data Science" specialization on Coursera.org educational platform.

This document also includes information about source dataset and description of how it was transformed to get the final "Tidy" dataset requred by the assignment.

******
## 1. Source DataSet
The source data set for this assignment is called "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones". [Download source dataset...](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).  
  

Originally it was obtained from "UCI Machine Learning Repository"  

This source data set contains data of the experiment in which volunteers were asked to perform several activities (walking, sitting, laying, etc) while wearing a smarthone on the waist. Signals from smarthone's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors we catpured, pre-processed, and put into the dataset.

## 2. "Tidy" DataSet (result of script execution)

## 3. Source to "Tidy" DataSet transformations

1. Loaded activity labels from 'activity_labels.txt'
2. Loaded features from 'features.txt'
3. Filtered only features that are mean or std using following regular expression: ```'(mean|std)\\(\\)' ```
4. Applied following transformations to features names:
+ replaced 'Acc' with 'Accelerator'
+ replaced 'Gyro' with 'Gyroscope'
+ replaced 'Mag' with 'Magnitude'
+ replaced 't' at the beginning of the name with 'time'
+ replaced 'f' at the beginning of the name with 'frequency'
+ replaced 'mean()' with 'Mean'
+ replaced 'std()' with 'Std'
+ removed '-'
5. Loaded SubjectTest, XTest and YTest from source files
6. Filtered XTest columns in accordance with features dataset
7. Appended YTest and SubjectTest columns to XTest
8. Loaded SubjectTrain, XTrain and YTrain from source files
9. Filtered XTrain columns in accordance with features dataset
10. Appended YTrain and SubjectTrain columns to XTrain
11. Merged rows of XTest and XTrain into resultDataset
12. Created 'tidy' dataset by grouping resultDataset by subject and activity and calculating average of each variable in each group.
